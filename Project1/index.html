        <h4>SUMMARY</h4>
        <p>
            "Few things defines us as a people"... anomymous. At this stage in my lifetime, I am more focused on what defines me,
            that been said, i am an average person who strive to give my best in all endevous. I want to be know a proffesional 
            so bad that all the self taugh tutorial wasn't satisfiying. The zeal to learn from an expert prompted me to enroll in
            Alt school Africa and i intend to build solution that problem in a professional way
            ... and that how i want to be identified!

        <h4>MY STORY</h4>
        <p> 
            As I reflect on my journey, I am reminded of the humble beginnings that have shaped me into 
            the person I am today. Born into a low-income family with both parents being retired teachers, I 
            have always been driven to succeed and make a better life for myself. Growing up, I was 
            fascinated by the way things work, and this curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Electrical 
            Electronic Education.
        </p>
        <p> 
            It wasn't until my third year of undergraduate studies that I was introduced to coding, and it was 
            like a whole new world opened up for me. I enrolled in a senior student class to learn C++ and 
            digital electronics, and from that moment on, I was hooked. The thrill of bringing ideas to life 
            through code sparked a passion in me that has only grown stronger with time.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I delved deeper into the world of coding, I discovered my true interest lies in backend 
            engineering. There's something about building the backbone of an application or system that 
            excites me. My ultimate goal is to work on Internet of Things (IoT) projects, creating innovative 
            solutions that make people's lives easier and more convenient. The idea of building cool projects 
            that can positively impact society is what drives me every day.
        </p>
        <p>
            owever, pursuing my dreams has not been without its challenges. As a student from a lowincome family, financing my education has always been a struggle. My parents, despite their best 
            efforts, cannot afford to support me fully. This is why the scholarship would be a game-changer 
            for me. It would help alleviate the burden of saving for tuition fees and laptop expenses at the 
            same time.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the scholarship, I would be able to focus on my studies without worrying about how to pay 
            for them. It would give me the freedom to explore different areas of backend engineering and 
            IoT development without financial constraints holding me back. Moreover, it would enable me 
            to acquire the necessary tools and resources needed to build projects that can showcase my skills 
            and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that this scholarship will not only help me achieve my academic goals but also 
            empower me to make a meaningful contribution to the tech industry. It will give me the 
            opportunity to learn from experienced professionals, network with like-minded individuals, and 
            gain hands-on experience working on real-world projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, I am grateful for this opportunity to apply for the scholarship. It represents a 
            chance for me to break free from financial constraints and pursue my passion for backend 
            engineering and IoT development without limits. I am confident that with this support, I will be 
            able to unlock my full potential and create innovative solutions that can make a positive impact 
            on society.
